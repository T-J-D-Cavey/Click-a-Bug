## What is this project?

Click-a-bug is a single-page-application (SPA) project showcasing React and Redux managing an app with complex state. 

The app imitates a 'whack-a-mole' game, where users see a grid (of servers) and have to 'click' (or tap) on any bugs that appear. There's a timer, a score and a lives-left metric. Click on the wrong thing or take too long, and the bugs will take over!

## Why was this project made?

This project was made in order to reinforce learnings of how React components and Redux state management work together, managing an app with lots of elements working together seamlessly. 

It's not perfectly written and could be refactored in a number of places. The focus was to keep as much 'state' within the redux store, to seperate areas of concern into individual components, and to have a retro-game-looking, simple design.
